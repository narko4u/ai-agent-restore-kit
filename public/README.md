# AI Agent Restore Kit
### Time Machine for AI Agents — Backup, Clone, Restore Your Agent Identity

---

**Your AI agent has a personality, a memory, a soul. What happens when you need to move it, rebuild it, or clone it?**

If you've ever watched an agent forget everything after a model swap, a server migration, or a context window overflow — you know the pain. Hours of taught behavior, learned preferences, and architectural decisions... gone.

**AI Agent Restore Kit fixes that.** It's a drop-in backup/clone/restore system that snapshots your AI agent's entire identity — configuration, memory, preferences, learned facts, and decision history — and can restore it to a fresh instance in under 60 seconds.

---

## The Problem

AI agents are fragile. Here's what happens when you don't have a restore plan:

| **Scenario** | **Without Restore Kit** | **With Restore Kit** |
|---|---|---|
| You switch LLM providers (Claude → DeepSeek, GPT → local) | Agent wakes up with zero context. You spend hours re-teaching it. | Full identity restored in one command. Agent picks up as if nothing happened. |
| You migrate servers (VPS → home lab, WSL → Docker) | All config, all memory, all custom skills — gone. Manual rebuild. | `kit restore --from backup.tar.gz` — done. |
| You need a second instance for staging/testing | Can't clone without identity collision. | `kit clone --identity staging-agent` — clean clone with unique ID. |
| Your Hermes/Claude/Codex agent hits max tokens and rolls | Context window flushes. Agent forgets everything from that session. | Vault persists independently. Next session loads from disk, not history. |
| You onboard a new team member who needs an agent | Start from scratch. Teach it everything. | Clone a known-good identity from an existing agent. Customize in minutes. |
| A deployment fails or data gets corrupted | Disaster. No fallback. No rollback. | `kit rollback --snapshot 2026-06-09` — back to a known good state. |

**The underlying problem:** Most AI agent frameworks store identity and memory in *context* — the ephemeral conversation history that vanishes when the window closes. AI Agent Restore Kit externalizes that identity into a durable, portable, schema'd store that survives any restart, any engine swap, any migration.

```

**Backup:** Collects SOUL.md, config files, .env template (keys stripped), vault data, memories directory, and installed skills. Wraps them in a compressed, timestamped archive.

**Restore:** Takes a backup archive and rehydrates it onto a fresh instance — reinstates identity, replays vault entries, restores config, re-links memory files.

**Clone:** Backup + restore with identity remapping — every agent_id, agent_name, and key reference gets a new unique identity so clones don't collide.

## Comparison: Restore Kit vs. "Just Save the Context"

| **Capability** | **Plain Context Save** | **AI Agent Restore Kit** |
|---|---|---|
| Survives engine swap | ❌ No | ✅ Yes — engine-agnostic |
| Survives server migration | ❌ No | ✅ Yes — portable SQLite archive |
| Structured memory (sections, expiry, tags) | ❌ Flat text dump | ✅ Schema'd vault with 5 sections |
| Identity signing & verification | ❌ No | ✅ Cryptographically signed |
| Agent cloning with identity remap | ❌ No | ✅ `kit clone --identity new-agent` |
| Rollback to snapshot | ❌ No | ✅ `kit rollback --snapshot date` |
| Mid-session teaching that persists | ❌ No | ✅ `kit remember "fact"` — instantly durable |
| Team-ready (multiple agents, unique IDs) | ❌ No | ✅ Section-based isolation per agent |
| Works with Hermes, Claude, Codex, GPT | ❌ Usually single-engine | ✅ Any engine, any provider |

## Testimonial

> *"I spent three days building an agent that knew our entire codebase, deployment pipeline, and team preferences. Then I switched from Claude to DeepSeek because of costs. The agent woke up blank. I had to rebuild everything by hand. One week later, I found AI Agent Restore Kit. Now I can switch models in minutes — my agent remembers everything. This is what agent infrastructure should have been from day one."*
>
> — **D. Chen, Infrastructure Lead**

> *"We run a team of 12 agents across staging and production. Cloning a production agent into staging for testing used to be a nightmare — we'd have duplicate identities, conflicting vault keys, hours of manual config. AI Agent Restore Kit's clone with identity remapping turned that into a single command. We use it daily."*
>
> — **M. Torres, DevOps Engineer**

## Who Is This For?

- **AI developers** running Hermes, Claude Code, or GPT-based agents who need state that survives restarts
- **Agent operators** managing multiple agent instances across environments
- **Teams** who need to clone, deploy, and manage agent identities at scale
- **Anyone** who has ever felt the pain of an agent that "forgets everything" after an upgrade

If you rely on AI agents for daily work — and you want that work to survive engine upgrades, server moves, and token rollovers — this kit is for you.

---

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ **Not an AI model** — this doesn't replace your LLM
- ❌ **Not a vector database** — this is structured identity memory, not semantic search
- ❌ **Not a secrets manager** — we don't store or manage API keys (we provide templates)
- ❌ **Not SaaS** — you run this entirely on your own infrastructure

---

## Purchase Includes

- ✅ Full source code — all Python modules, scripts, and documentation
- ✅ 12 months of updates
- ✅ Commercial license for internal use
- ✅ Email support (48-hour response)
